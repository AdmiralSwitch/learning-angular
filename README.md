Learning AngularJS
================
So I've been meaning to learn AngularJS for some time now and I've watched a few videos here and there but kept on dropping and never building anything concrete. This repo will help me track my progress through two curriculums I've found on thinkster.io:  
1. [A Better Way to Learn AngularJS](http://www.thinkster.io/angularjs/GtaQ0oMGIl/a-better-way-to-learn-angularjs)
2. [AngularJS Tutorial: Learn to build Modern Webapps](http://www.thinkster.io/angularjs/r1gRPYp4kM/angularjs-tutorial-learn-to-build-modern-webapps)

This repository will also include code from other sources which I will cite in the comments and below when I find them. 

This README will also track some codes, gotchas, comments and other shenanigans to help others like me learning AngularJS for the first/second/third time. Hope this helps!
